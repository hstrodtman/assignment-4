                The data that I collected was used to inventory species, make management plans and protect threatened species. </p>

                <p id = "herp-text"  class = "body-text">My favorite position as a field biologist was working on a project in the Missouri Ozarks investigating the impacts of forest management on amphibians, 
                reptiles and mammals. At this position I used various trapping methods to collect animals and identified, measured and marked the animals before releasing them. 
                This data became part of an ongoing 100 year study designed to test if different timber harvest strategies affected the number of animals present at a location.</p>

                    large mammals and bats. Some of the coolest animals I encountered were an adorable flying squirrel and a very angry chipmunk that nearly chewed through the metal trap he was in!

                <p id = "plover-text"  class = "body-text">One of my favorite locations to work was on Sanibel Island in Florida. While there, I led a small team researching Snowy Plovers, a threatened shorebird 
                species. We collected data on the bird's nest locations, brood survival and food availability. These birds lay their nests directly on sandy ground, which meant I got to walk the beach for work everyday!</p>

                    Kansas State University I collected data for a project looking at the effects of wind power development on greater prairie-chickens. Even though I got 
                    hands on experience trapping game birds and using radio-telemetry you couldn't pay me enough to work in Kansas again.

                Department of Natural Resources to  create a management strategy for sharp-tailed grouse. I did this by modeling the grouse's habitat use and estimating their 
                response to alternative habitat and harvest management scenarios. It was at this position that I had my first encountered with programming when I used R statistical software
                for my analysis.</p>
