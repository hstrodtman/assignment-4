            <p class = "intro-text"> From 2008 to 2015 I worked as a wildlife field biologist. During this time I traveled the country working with birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. 
                The data that I collected was used to inventory species, make management plans and protect threatened species. Below are some of the many studies I've worked on. </p>

                    <p>My favorite position as a field biologist was working as a herpetology and small mammal technician in the Missouri Ozarks. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impacts of forest management on amphibians, 
                        reptiles and mammals. At this position I used various trapping methods to collect animals and identified, measured and marked the animals before releasing them. 
                        This data became part of an ongoing 100 year study designed to test if different timber harvest strategies affected the number of animals present at a location.</p>

                    <p>In northern Alabama I worked on a project designed to inventory the mammals of the region. I used Sherman traps (small metal traps), game cameras and echolocation software to look for small and 
                        large mammals and bats. Some of the coolest animals I encountered were a flying squirrel and a very angry chipmunk that nearly chewed through the metal trap he was in!

                    <p>One of my favorite locations to work was on Sanibel Island in Florida. While there, I led a small team researching Snowy Plovers, a threatened shorebird 
                        species. We collected data on the bird's nest locations, brood survival and food availability. These birds lay their nests directly on sandy ground, which meant I got to walk the beach for work everyday!</p>

                    <p>One of the most interesting species I have worked with is the Greater Prairie Chicken. These birds have bright orange air-sacks on their necks and perform elaborate dances in the spring. 
                        Working for Kansas State University I collected data for a project looking at the effects of wind power development on the birds. Even though it was only for 3 months, I learned many new skills such as trapping game birds and using radio-telemetry.

                    <p>In 2012 I moved to East Lansing, Michigan to pursue a masters in Fisheries and Wildlife at Michigan State University. While there, I worked as a graduate research assistant with the Michigan
                        Department of Natural Resources to  create a management strategy for sharp-tailed grouse. I did this by modeling the grouse's habitat use and estimating their 
                        response to alternative habitat and harvest management scenarios. It was at this position that I had my first encounter with programming when I used R statistical software
                        for my analysis.</p>
