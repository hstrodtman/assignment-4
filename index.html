            <p id = "intro-text"> From 2008 to 2015 I worked as a wildlife field biologist. During this time I traveled the country working with birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. The data that I collected
                was used to inventory species, make management plans and protect threatened species. </p>

            <p id = "herp-text">My favorite position as a wildlife biologist was working on a project in the Missouri Ozarks investigating the impacts of forest management on amphibians, 
            reptiles and mammals. At this position I used various trapping methods to collect animals and identified, measured and marked the animals before releasing them. 
            The data I collected was used to determine if different timber harvest strategies affected the number of animals present at a location.</p>

                <p id ="mammal-text">In northen Alabama I worked on a project designed to inventory mammals in the region. I used Sherman traps, game cameras, and ecolocation software to look for small mammals, 
                large mammals, and bats. Some of the coolest animals I encoutered were an adorable flying squirrel and a very angry chipmunk that nearly chewed through the metal trap he was in!

            <p id = "plover-text">One of my favorite locations to work was on Sanibel Island in Florida. While there, I led a small team researching Snowy Plovers, a threatened shore bird 
            species. These birds lay their nests directly on sandy ground, which meant I got to walk the beach for work everyday!</p>

            <p id = "chicken-text">Even though it was only for 3 months, my time working in Kansas was hands down my least favorite job of all time due to the LONG hours and low pay. Working for
                Kansas State University I collected data for a project looking at the effects of wind power development on greater prairie-chickens. Even though I got 
                hands on experience trapping game birds and using radio-telemetry you couldn't pay me enough to work in Kansas again.

            <p id="grouse-text">In 2012 I moved to East Lansing, Michigan to pursue a masters in Fisheries and Wildlife at Michigan State University. While there, I work with the Michigan
            Department of Natural Resources to  create a management strategy for sharp-tailed grouse. I did this by modeling the grouse's habitat use and estimating their 
            response to alternative habitat and harvest management scenarios. It was at this position that I had my first encounted with programming when I used R statistical software
            for my analysis.</p>
